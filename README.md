Plot weather data and have different web pages for the visualizations and their relations:

* A landing page that has and explanation of the project and links to each visualization page.
* Four visualization pages that have: Latitude vs. Max Temperature, Latitude vs. Humidity, Latitude vs. Cloudiness, and Latitude vs. Wind Speed.
* A "Comparisons" page to compare all the visualizations together
* A "Data" page that displays a responsive table that contains all the data used in all the visualizations.
